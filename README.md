 =======================================================================
 
 Author: Song Ge
 
 The demo code is an implementation of the CVPR Workshop paper:
 
Song Ge, Guoliang Fan, et al., "Non-rigid Point Set Registration with  Global-Local Topology Preservation".
 
The demo code is implementated using MATLAB for nonrigid articulaged registration.The implementation is modified from CPD open source. 

The code is used for academic purpose only. If you use the code in your paper, please cite the paper above. 

Usage:

1. Set the gltp/cpd folder into the MATLAB path.
2. The template model and five sample target models (SCAPE models) are stored in data folder. 
3. Run gltp-scape-example for articulated registration.
4. The parameter settings cloud be found in the paper.
